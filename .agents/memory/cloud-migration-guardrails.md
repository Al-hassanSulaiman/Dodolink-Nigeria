description: User requirements for staging the DodoLink Google Cloud migration and preserving the existing deployment.
---

The user authorized beginning a staged Google Cloud migration and selected `africa-south1` (Johannesburg). Keep the existing Replit deployment intact through validation and cutover; do not delete the existing service. Preserve the existing DodoLink domains and API paths where possible.

**Why:** The user explicitly requested continuity on Replit while the Google Cloud target is validated.

**How to apply:** Establish a verified source-data baseline and validate the Google Cloud deployment before moving production traffic. Treat the existing Replit deployment as the rollback target, not infrastructure to remove during setup.
